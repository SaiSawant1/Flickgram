Social Media App
This is a social media web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and is designed to practice full-stack web development. The application provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing user accounts and posts.

Getting Started
To get started with the application, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your local machine.

Clone the repository
Install dependencies by running npm install
Start the development server by running npm run dev
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Functionality
User Authentication
Users can sign up for an account or log in with an existing account. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to ensure secure storage.

User Profiles
Each user has a profile page that displays their username, profile picture, and a list of their posts. Users can edit their profile information and profile picture.

Posts
Users can create new posts with text, images, and links. Posts can be edited and deleted by the user who created them. All users can view a feed of all posts on the home page.
